### Test Automation Jumpstart Workshop - 2 Days

#### Target Coverage

1. Foundations of Test Automation: Introduces the core concepts, objectives, and benefits of test automation. Emphasizes how automation improves efficiency but requires strategic planning and initial investment.
2. GUI Automation Foundations: Covers the basics of automating graphical user interface interactions for web applications. Highlights the importance of understanding element locators, actions, and user interaction simulation.
3. Challenges in GUI Automation: Discusses common pitfalls in GUI automation, such as handling dynamic content and synchronization issues. Addresses potential solutions like using explicit waits and robust locator strategies.
4. Web Services Test Automation: Provides an overview of testing web services, focusing on RESTful APIs and their automation. Explains the integration of API tests within larger test suites for comprehensive coverage.
5. Challenges in Web Service Automation: Details the obstacles in automating API testing, with specific focus on protocol, parsing and schema. Proposes techniques to ensure test reliability and meaningful validation.
6. Test Engine and Framework Design: Outlines the design and development of a modular test framework for better maintainability and scalability. Discusses the use of test engines and custom libraries for advanced test management. Also discusses configurability and data-driven testing.
7. Test Fixtures: Explains the setup and teardown processes that ensure consistent testing environments. Highlights how test fixtures help maintain test independence and repeatability.
8. Test Result Reporting: Focuses on the importance of capturing and presenting test results in an informative way. Reviews tools and methods for generating reports that aid in swift analysis and decision-making.
9. Co-existence with Manual Testing: Emphasizes the need to balance automation with manual testing for optimal coverage. Discusses when manual testing is preferred and how it complements automated efforts to achieve quality. Explores the concept of partial automation.
